# ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain + Next.js Starter Template

This template scaffolds a simple LangChain.js + Next.js starter template. It has one endpoint, `POST /api/chat`, that streams back a model call to
the frontend. It uses Vercel's [`ai` SDK](https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai) to pipe the stream back to the client as well as display the incoming messages.
